     * original source which results in a new URI being minted.  Normally, however, you would only use this in cases
     * where {@link #exists(Object)} returns false, meaning there is no object in ZOOMA with a matching URI.  If calling

     * By contract, this method should return true if and only if {@link #findModified(Object)} will return a non-null

     * allow smarter datasources to optimize with quick modification lookups if possible.
